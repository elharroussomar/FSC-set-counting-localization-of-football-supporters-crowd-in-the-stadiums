# FSC-set-counting-localization-of-football-supporters-crowd-in-the-stadiums

This repository contains the datasets of football supporters crowd in the stadium for the paper:

"FSC-set: counting, localization of football supporters crowd in the stadiums"

The crowd counting and localization data is intended to support research in dense crowd analysis. This dataset can be found : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A_6ohodGYK7M_ZCyBugny1PP4FJv4u0Y?usp=sharing

## Dataset Overview

The FSC-Set (Football Supporters Crowd Dataset) is a large-scale collection of images designed for crowd counting and individual localization in highly dense stadium environments. The annotations provide precise ground truth data for developing and evaluating advanced computer vision models, particularly those involved in edge detection and high-resolution feature analysis.
